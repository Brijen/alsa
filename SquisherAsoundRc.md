    # 2008-02-17: 8-channel card required
    #
    # This .asoundrc will allow the following:
    #
    # - upmix stereo files to 5.1 speakers.
    # - playback real 5.1 sounds, on 5.1 speakers,
    # - allow the playback of both stere(oupmixed) and surround(5.1) sources at the same time.
    # - use the 6th and 7th channel (side speakers) as a separate soundcard, i.e. for headphones
    #   (This is called the "alternate" output throughout the file, device names prefixed with 'a')
    # - play mono sources in stereo (like skype & ekiga) on the alterate output
    #
    # Make sure you have "8 Channels" and NOT "6 Channels" selected in alsamixer!
    # This file was tested on an nforce board with realtek alc888 chipset, but should work on
    # any 8-channel card. Read through the comments if you have a different soundcard though!
    #
    # Please try the following commands, to make sure everything is working as it should.
    #
    # To test stereo upmixÂ :      speaker-test -c2 -Ddefault -twav
    # To test surround(5.1):      speaker-test -c6 -Dplug:dmix6 -twav
    # To test alternative output: speaker-test -c2 -Daduplex -twav
    # To test mono upmix:         speaker-test -c1 -Dmonoduplex -twav
    #
    #
    # It may not work out of the box for all cards. If it doesnt work for you, read the comments throughout the file.
