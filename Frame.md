A **frame** is a set of
[samples](?title=Sample&action=edit&redlink=1 "Sample (page does not exist)"),
one per [channel](/Channel "Channel"), at a particular instant in time.
For stereophonic audio, a frame consists of two samples. For [Dolby 5.1
Surround
Sound](?title=Dolby_5.1_Surround_Sound&action=edit&redlink=1 "Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound (page does not exist)"),
a frame would consist of six samples (left channel, center channel,
right channel, rear right, rear left, and the low frequency channel).
For monophonic audio, a frame is equivalent to one sample.
