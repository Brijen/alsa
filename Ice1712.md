The **ice1712** driver is used for sound cards that use the Envy24
chipset. These include several models from
[Terratec](http://www.terratec.net/) and
[M-Audio](http://www.midiman.com/index.php?do=products.list&ID=pciinterfaces)
(formerly Midiman). Such cards are generally professional quality
multi-track sound cards.

Notes
-----

1.  Midiman cards consistently get good reports for sound quality and
    are recommended often as a good choice between price and
    professionalism.
2.  Many but not all users complain about sound glitches. This may be
    due to the cards being IRQ hungry.

There is a special control panel and mixer program called
[envy24control](/Envy24control "Envy24control") which allows you to set
up and use your ice1712-based sound card. envy24control is contained in
the [alsa-tools](ftp://ftp.alsa-project.org/pub/tools) package. A patch
for envy24control to use GTK+ 2.0 is available
[here](http://www.lstud.ii.uib.no/~s864/alsa). The following cards use
the ice1712 driver. Info taken from [ALSA

sound glitches, i wan't you to say, that this was for me, on a
m-audio1010lt, a problem in the bios. The option, which i had to
disable, was "PCI Delay Transaction", to get this really disturbing
glitches away. My mainboard is a asus a7v880, whith a via kt880/via
vt8237. Also i often heard, that it is useful to set the "PCI Busmaster
Waitstate" to a higher number than it is bios default. IRQ sharing is
also sometimes a problem, and the "PCI Burst Mode" is also a good tip,
but in my bios i don't have this option.*

wrote on 2009-05-03: I also encountered irq problems with my MAudio
Audiophile 2496. Setting the PCI Latency Timer in BIOS higher helped,
but not all my glitches went away (especially while using cpu frequency
scaling). Since this was the only adjustable option in BIOS I had to
find another solution. Looking at /proc/interrupts I saw that ICE1712,
nvidia onboard graphic and the nic almost only ask the 2nd cpu for an
interrupt:

    19:        101      38496   IO-APIC-fasteoi   ICE1712
    21:        469     312415   IO-APIC-fasteoi   ehci_hcd:usb1, nvidia
    1272:      1250    451983   PCI-MSI-edge      eth0

So I did "echo 00000001 \>/proc/irq/19/smp\_affinity", which basically
tells the system to only ask the 1st cpu for interrupts on IRQ 19, and
guess what - the occasional sound glitches are gone! Hope this helps
others facing the same issue.

as I use the 1010 with jackd. However, I was confused as to why I would
get sample rate errors when trying to play through the card (2 on my
system) using normal alsa programs e.g. ` `

    $ alsaplayer -o alsa -d hw:2,0
    error on set_format SND_PCM_FORMAT_S16

The solution is to use plughw: instead of hw: - thanks to Demian Martin
