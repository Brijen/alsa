Extra notes
-----------

To get recording to work, make sure that the mixer control *AD Input
Select* is set to off (muted).

You might also need to set the *Mic +5V bias* control to on using
something like

` `

    $ amixer cset numid=43 on
    numid=43,iface=CARD,name='Mic +5V bias'
      ; type=BOOLEAN,access=rw---,values=1
      : values=on
    $ 

The magic number '43' can be found from the output of `amixer controls`:

` `

    $ amixer controls
    numid=43,iface=CARD,name='Mic +5V bias'
    numid=42,iface=CARD,name='PCM 0 Output also on Line-In Jack'
    numid=3,iface=MIXER,name='Master Mono Playback Switch'
    ...
    $ 

For type CT4700, the one with 2 line-out jacks (green / black), you have
to set number \`42\` control to on for enabling "hw:0,1" output on line1
and "hw:0,0" on \_both\_ line2 & line1.

*Did this in my "/etc/asound.state", setting "value true" (SuSE9.3).*

The (KMix) mixer setting "pcm0" (the leftmost) is for "hw:0,0" -\>
line1; so you can set "pcm0" to "0" for having one output exclusive for
one DA-hw: 0,0-\>2 and 0,1-\>1

The mixer setting "pcm1" (2. left) sets level of "hw:0,1" -\> line1.

I found no way so far to set level for "hw:0,0" output -\> line2, is
allway 100% (nor "hw:0,1" -\> line2, allways 0%).

Only line1 has a onboard speaker-amp, which you can enable by
jumper-setting. At line2, you have to use external amp or active
speakers, you will not hear more than whisper even with headset.

Using "hw:0,1" for VoIP with internal amp and headphone on line1; and
"hw:0,0" with active speaker on line2 works for me.

However, microphone is on "hw:0,0" only.
