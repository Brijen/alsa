What is a Sound Font
--------------------

A SoundFont bank (or SoundFont-compatible bank) contains both the
digital audio samples which have been captured from a sound source, and
the instructions to the wavetable synthesizer on how to articulate this
sound based on the musical or sonic context as expressed by MIDI (called
articulation data). A SoundFont bank also contains information about the
creation and intended use of the particular bank. Josh Green has a good
introduction to the SoundFont technology
[here](http://swami.sourceforge.net/sfont_intro.php) and an FAQ is at
[soundfont.com](http://www.soundfont.com/faqs.html). The free technical
specification for the 2.01 version of DLS SoundFonts can also be
downloaded from soundfont.com.

`SoundFont` 2.0 License
-----------------------

E-MU / ENSONIQ and Creative Technology are actively promoting SoundFont
2.0 as an open standard. We have worked diligently on getting complete,
unambiguous documentation and a suite of tools available for developers
who might want to use the SoundFont 2.0 format. After a year of
experience with SoundFont 1.0, E-MU / ENSONIQ and Creative Technology
realized there had been a number of omissions in the SoundFont 1.0
realization of the original SoundFont concept. Rather than sticking to
the SoundFont 1.0 format and putting up with these inadequacies,
E-mu/Creative determined that the public release of the SoundFont
standard would be a good time to make a clean sweep and revised the
format to include all the necessary features.

It seems the actual PDF specification cannot be redistributed but the
content and spirit of the specification is free for use by all. In other
words, we cannot include the PDF file in open source distributions but
we can link to it and freely use the standard. (If anyone has any views
on this, either way, please say so).
