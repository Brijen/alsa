The [ThinkPad600](/ThinkPad600 "ThinkPad600") can use this driver.
Probably other [ThinkPads](/ThinkPad "ThinkPad") can as well.

Module options
--------------

` `

    modprobe snd-cs4236 isapnp=0 cport=0xf00 dma1=1 dma2=0 fm_port=0x220 port=0x530 mpu_port=0x388 mpu_irq=9

after that: ` `

    modprobe snd-pcm-oss

note: this works for me on a HP2100 Omnibook (PII 233), kernel 2.4.19
and alsa 0.9.0rc6. You may need to modify some values. dmesg should give
you a clue. I've seen things like cport=0x120, port=0x534,
mpu\_port=0x300 ... For a HP4100 Omnibook,I found the first set of
values works, provided I set the sound card to "Enabled" rather than
"Auto" in the BIOS setup.

note: In an old Dell GX1, I need to disable ACPI from the BIOS in order
to have ALSA to work. Don't know why? (using ALSA 0.9.6 Linux 2.4.20r7
gentoo) However, I don't need to specify any option in snd-cs4236 and
also I don't need to use isapnp.
