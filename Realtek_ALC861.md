I have recently bought a Toshiba Satellite laptop which was equipped
with that sound chip. The problem I have encountered was that while
under Windows the sound quality was good, under Linux (Fedora Core 6)
the sound was very noisy and there were a lot of cracks.
Southern\_Gentlem from \#fedora channel has suggested that the noises
are caused by some feedback from line-in and that they can be sent into
oblivion by muting that item. As the laptop does not even have a line-in
socket, I have muted that without hesitation, and voila, the noises were
gone. Hopefully this text will save someone from intense head
scratching.
