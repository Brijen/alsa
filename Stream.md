A **stream** is a continuous sequence of [frames](/Frame "Frame") that,
when processed in realtime, produces audio.

Sound hardware, such as a sound card, may support multiple streams. Each
"stream" is an audio source input, which is then mixed together for
output. For example, you might play two mp3 files at the same time and
hear them both on the output. Sound hardware which is capable of mixing
streams must have an internal "mixer". Some older sound cards, before
1997, may not support multiple streams.
