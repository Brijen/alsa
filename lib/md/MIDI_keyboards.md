A MIDI keyboard is a piano keyboard with special electronics for sending
and receiving [MIDI](/MIDI "MIDI") files. Recent MIDI keyboards have a
sound quality as good as or better than mid-price grand pianos and
upright pianos. Recent MIDI keyboards also have a weighted key mechanism
which feels truly ***identical*** to the keys of a grand piano.

If you are considering which musical instrument to buy for making music,
a MIDI keyboard is an excellent choice because

-   MIDI keyboards are designed to be connected to other [MIDI
    devices](?title=MIDI_devices&action=edit&redlink=1 "MIDI devices (page does not exist)")
    including computers which have a [MIDI
    interface](/MIDI_interface "MIDI interface") on their
    [soundcard](/Soundcard "Soundcard"). This is ideal for composing
    music with the help of music composition software like
    [Rosegarden](/Rosegarden "Rosegarden") or [MusE](/MusE "MusE").

-   MIDI keyboards do not ever need to be tuned, thus saving the cost of
    regular piano tuning.
-   MIDI keyboards have a volume control and can be used with
    headphones. This is very useful if you do not want to disturb other
    people.
-   MIDI keyboards are much more portable than ordinary pianos, weighing
    only about 70kg/150lbs and being about the same size as an upright
    piano.
-   MIDI keyboards can play music automatically like a virtual virtuoso
    accompanist.

There are many different makes of MIDI keyboard: *Yamaha*, *Roland*,
*Korg*, etc. It is best to get a MIDI keyboard with **"weighted keys"**
that move and feel like real piano keys. The price range is USD
1000-3000. I personally prefer *Yamaha Clavinovas* and think the
**Yamaha CLP-170 Clavinova** (at time of writing this in 2004) is equal
in sound quality and touch to any mid-price grand piano -- a really
excellent musical instrument!
