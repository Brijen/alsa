MidiComp

Apologies for this not being strictly an ALSA utility but the end result
of using it with MIDI files certainly requires ALSA.

MidiComp is a program to manipulate SMF (Standard MIDI File) files and
will both read and write SMF files in 0 or format 1 and also read and
write it's own plain text format. This means a SMF file can be turned
into easily parseble text, edited with any text editor or filtered
through any script language, and "recompiled" back into a binary SMF
file.

The package can be downloaded from

Pedro Lopez-Cabanillas to the Linux Audio Users mailing-list... It is
nice to know that there are several alternatives to choose. I've found
more references at linux-sound.org:

Both Midge and GMC are based on some kind of music description
languages. In this area is worth to mention Lilypond because it
generates MIDI files and nice scores at the same time, using also an
input text describing the music. OTOH, midicomp and midicsv are very
similar, based on a text format representation very near to the SMF
format.
