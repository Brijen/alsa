With the latest update of Fedora Core 5, I am able to use the
combination of RME Hammerfall DSP Multiface II and HDSP PCI Card. I was
able to write a simple audio playback routine. Before I move on to
writing a complex application, I wanted to know if the ALSA support of
the combination of RME Hammerfall DSP Multiface II and HDSP PCI Card is
solid. The Web seems to suggest that ALSA is solid only for RME 9632 and
9652. Is this true?
