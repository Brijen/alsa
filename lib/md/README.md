#### 2013-08-27 - Mobile Friendly Bootstrap

_[Mark Constable]:_ I am so impressed with the latest Bootstrap 3 template
in how it can readjust itself to a small mobile sized device. Try reducing
your browser width to about what a mobile phone would be a take note how
the page elements change to suit the smaller screen. Wonderful stuff.

#### 2013-08-11 - Conversion to Markdown at Github

_[Mark Constable]:_ This is a crude re-rendering of the MediaWiki contents
using Markdown formatted files and Github for project and user management.
The content is rough and just a first mechanical cut at conversion from the
original MediaWiki format.

The previous wiki was plagued with spam and I was sick of not understanding
MediaWiki well enough to manage the right plugins to combat spam. It was a
mess with new user signups mostly disabled and I had long ago decided to
migrate the wiki to some kind of Git based management system. A recent
server crash focussed my attention after discovering (for a second time)
that the older MySQL database format would not work with a more recent
version so rather than mess around with incomaptible MySQL versions I may
as well mess around with a Git based Markdwn system instead. After an
initial start at the beginning of 2013 I finally have something that seems
to work but now needs a lot of manual TLC on each page to get them into
reasonable shape.
