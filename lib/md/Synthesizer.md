A synthesizer is a hardware capability of a
[soundcard](/Soundcard "Soundcard") which can be used to generate an
audio [stream](/Stream "Stream") from software rather than from
recordings. To emulate a real musical instrument, sample notes are
recorded and stored in a
[wavetable](?title=Wavetable&action=edit&redlink=1 "Wavetable (page does not exist)").
The synthesizer steps through the wavetable reading out and playing back
the sample values. Altering the step size when reading the wavetable
allows the synthesis of notes with different frequencies.
