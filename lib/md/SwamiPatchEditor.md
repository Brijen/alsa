From the home page above: Swami (Sample Waveforms and Audio for Magical
Instruments) is an instrument patch editor with plans to be much more.
It currently allows editing of [SoundFont](/SoundFont "SoundFont") files
and uses iiwusynth for software synthesis, so pretty much any sound card
can be used. iiwusynth gives us real time effect control and SoundFont
2.01 modulator support for controlling effects in real time with MIDI
controls.
