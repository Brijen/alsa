The Audigy LS capture controls are different from most. Run alsamixer
1.0.6. It should give you separate playback and capture controls. Press
F4 for the Capture controls.

1.  Select one of the following sources:
    -   AC97, SPDIF, UNKNOWN, What-u-hear.
    -   You should get a Red "CAPTUR" written over the control.
    -   For MIC and Line in, this will be AC97.

2.  Turn "Capture" control to 100% and un-mute it. (Make sure Red
    "CAPTUR" written over the control.)
3.  Turn "AC97 Line" control to 100% and un-mute it to record from line
    in. (Make sure Red "CAPTUR" written over the control.)
    *or*
