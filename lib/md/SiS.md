Sound driver for SiS 7012 embedded audio chip and Kernel 2.4.x is
provided by SiS at their download center.

or just follow this link :

Although, for me, (Elite K7S6A - SiS 745 chipset) the ALSA intel8x0
driver is working.

\> So some say, it can work with the intel8x0 ALSA-driver. Sorry, not
for me. If you have Windows, does the Realtek codec driver work with it.
If the Realtek one doesn't work, your motherboard manufacturer must of
opted to use another audio codec chip.

SiS, Silicon Integrated Systems (www.sis.com), they manufacture some
"all-in-one" mainboard chips, like the SiS 735 Chip with its build-in
AC'97 audio.

So some say, it can work with the intel8x0 ALSA-driver. Sorry, not for
me.

Problem is, SiS does not release their doc to the ALSA team (as of 20
Oct. 02).
