# Linux

Linux is a computer operating system (OS) for desktop and laptops, servers
and all kinds of embedded devices. It is **libre** software meaning its program
design (**source code**) is freely available for anyone to use, copy, modify,
sell, rent or publish. This makes Linux fundamentally different from the
Microsoft and Apple operating system, which do not allow their users any of
these freedoms. Several years ago Linux used to be quite difficult to use
but there are now versions of Linux with easy-to-use graphical user interfaces
and a huge amount of software ranging from office-productivity software to
complex scientific software. Linux uses the [ALSA] sound system to provide
support for multimedia applications.
