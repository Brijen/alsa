**S/PDIF** (**S**ony/**P**hilips **D**igital **I**nterface) is a
standard serial digital audio format. It is usually found on digital
audio equipment such as a DAT (Digital Audio Tape) machine or audio
processing device. It allows the transfer of audio from one piece of
equipment to another without the conversion to and from an analog
format, which could degrade the signal quality. The most common
connector used with an S/PDIF interface is the RCA connector, the same
one used for consumer audio products. An optical connector is also
sometimes used.

Sometimes used to send encoded AC3 bitstream to external decoder.
