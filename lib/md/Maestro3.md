i'm having bad hardware freezes on 2.4.20 / 2.4.21 with version 0.9.4,
on a dell c600 laptop. Any help appreciated

I am also having some serious lockups on 2.4.21 with a Dell 8100 laptop.
My current "dirty" solution to this is to compile as module and do a
rmmod when the sound stops working. /ziL (zilver.hellberg(at)home.se)

UPDATE: It works perfectly now (with the 2.6.5 and the latest alsa
version) /ziL

Extra notes
-----------

If you're looking for the maestro2 module, it's called
[es1968](/Es1968 "Es1968").
