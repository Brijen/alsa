Powermac, PowerBook G3/G4 and iMac/iBook
----------------------------------------

Use the very latest CVS, this driver is under development. You need the
module snd-powermac.

There is experimental support for auto-muting the speakers when
headphones are plugged in on the PowerBooks - it can be disabled by a
mixer switch.

On the Pismo G3, I found I had to toggle "MIC-BOOST" in alsamixer once
to get sound out of it - this small buglet is probably going to be
squshed soon.
