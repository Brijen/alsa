A **MIDI cable** is a special cable for connecting one MIDI device to
another MIDI device. Follow the link for more details of
[MIDI](/MIDI "MIDI"). At each end of a MIDI cable there is a
finger-sized round connector with either 5 metal pins inside (a "male
DIN connector") or 5 oblong slots (a "female DIN connector"). MIDI
cables up to 15**m** long are available although it is possible to
connect two or more 15**m** cables together to cover a distance of more
than 15**m** (a **MIDI line driver** may be necessary for distances over
30**m**). How to wire a MIDI connector is [described
here](http://www.philrees.co.uk/midiplug.htm).
