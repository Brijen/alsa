Au88x0
======

### From the ALSA wiki

Jump to: [navigation](#mw-head), [search](#p-search)

All cards based off of the Aureal 88x0 chipsets now have an ALSA driver!
For details, please visit
[http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/openvortex/](http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/openvortex/)

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Note:** In all of the notes below, you should replace au88x0 with au8830, au8820 or au8810 depending on which driver you have. You may be able to figure it out by looking at `/proc/pci` but we might want to have Wiki page about this.

-   Aureal SuperQuad Digital
-   Aureal SQ2500
-   Turtle Beach Montego II
-   Turtle Beach Montego 3DXtream
-   Digital Research Vortex 2

-   Hardware EQ
-   S/PDIF output

Compile and Install
-------------------

(NOTE: you can check which soundcard you have by: lspci (or lspci -v if
you want more info).)

NB. If you are using cvs then you need to type

` `

    ./cvscompile

instead of

` `

    ./configure.

In a shell type these commands:

Make a directory to store the alsa source code in.

` `

    cd /usr/src
    mkdir alsa
    cd alsa
    cp /downloads/alsa-* .

Now unzip and install the alsa-driver package

` `

    bunzip2 alsa-driver-xxx
    tar -xf alsa-driver-xxx
    cd alsa-driver-xxx
    ./configure --with-snd-card=au88x0  --with-sequencer=yes;

(NOTE: you may have to patch 4 make files before you run the make but
after you have run configure. I have put the patch and directions for
using it at the bottom of this page. It was contributed to alsa-devel
mail list by Eric Hathaway. This would also be a good time to read the
INSTALL file in the alsa-driver-xxx directory particularly the bits
about having kernel-sources installed - check by trying to install them
eg in Mdk9.1: urpmi kernel-source - and having sound loaded - do: lsmod
to see if it is and: modprobe sound if sound isn't in the list of loaded
modules resulting from: lsmod. There is also a section on
Troubleshooting which might be of use -it was to me!)

` `

    make;make install
    ./snddevices

Now unzip and install the alsa-lib package

` `

    cd ..
    bunzip2 alsa-lib-xxx
    tar -xf alsa-lib-xxx
    cd alsa-lib-xxx
    ./configure;make;make install

Now unzip and install the alsa-utils package

` `

    cd ..
    bunzip2 alsa-utils-xxx
    tar -xf alsa-utils-xxx
    cd alsa-utils-xxx
    ./configure;make;make install

Loading the modules
-------------------

Now insert the modules into the kernel space.

` `

    modprobe snd-au88x0 ;modprobe snd-pcm-oss;modprobe snd-mixer-oss; modprobe snd-seq-oss

There are a couple of ways to get the modules to load at boottime. One
is to modify the /etc/modules.conf (or add a snd-au88x0 file in
/etc/modutils for Debian users) and /etc/modules files. You can find
more information about /etc/modules.conf at [A short explanation of what
happens in the /etc/modules.conf
file](/A_short_explanation_of_what_happens_in_the_/etc/modules.conf_file "A short explanation of what happens in the /etc/modules.conf file").
If you add snd-au88x0 to /etc/modules, it will load automatically on
bootup, based on the options you have in /etc/modules.conf.

You can also look at the utils/alsasound file. This script is designed
for the RedHat distribution, but it can be used with other distributions
which use System V style rc init scripts. This will allow you to load
your modules at boot time. Of course if you want to do this you could
just compile them into the kernel instead and save yourself the hassle
of coming to terms with the rc init scripts.

Default options
---------------

I am not exactly sure what the defaults are, so if someone could fill
this in, please do.

Module Specific Options
-----------------------

If you want other special driver options, please post to the Savannah
Openvortex-dev list.

The module options to fix au88x0 cards on VIA chipsets with a broken PCI
implementation are listed below. These are known to work for KT133,
PLE133, and Apollo MVP3 chipsets (if you need it for your chipset,
please add it to the list!). It reduces crackling and prevents the
system from hard-locking when under stress (AGP transfers, heavy
processing, massive disk activity, etc.).

For MVP3 chipsets, you might have to force it to use mode 3 (both
fixes), as it may not autodetect properly. This is also the case for the
PLE133 chipset used on first-generation VIA EPIA motherboards.

The snd-au88?0 module parameter "pcifix" can take the following
parameters:

-   255: autodetect what has to be done (this is the default)
-   0: disable all tweaks
-   1: only apply aureal pci latency fix
-   2: only apply the via agp bridge "PCI \#2 Master Control" fix
-   3: apply both fixes

* * * * *

but where's the prameter "pcifix" in alsa-driver module snd-au8830?

` `

    # modinfo /lib/modules/2.4.22-ck3/kernel/sound/pci/au88x0/snd-au8830.o
    filename:    /lib/modules/2.4.22-ck3/kernel/sound/pci/au88x0/snd-au8830.o
    description: "Aureal vortex"
    author:      <none>
    license:     "GPL"
    parm:        index int array (min = 1, max = 8), description "Index value for Aureal Vortex 2 3D Sound Processor soundcard."
    parm:        id string array (min = 1, max = 8), description "ID string for Aureal Vortex 2 3D Sound Processor soundcard."
    parm:        enable int array (min = 1, max = 8), description "Enable Aureal Vortex 2 3D Sound Processor soundcard."

Other configuration
-------------------

Now you'll need to adjust your soundcard's volume levels. All mixer
channels are muted by default. You must use a native mixer program to
unmute appropriate channels, for example alsamixer from the alsa-utils
package or alsamixergui, available separately. Using alsamixergui makes
it much easier.

MX300 users (and possibly others which **should be noted here**): You
will probably need to set the "External Amplifier Power Down" to **On**.
When this is **Off**/muted the sound will be much quieter than one would
expect -- roughly 1/3 to 1/2 of that of the Windows driver. It can be
found near the end of the list in alsamixer. Hit *m* to un-mute the
**External** channel.

Other solution
--------------

Just want to play a few MP3's and only have one sound card?

Please note you should verify all of the following yourself as it is
simply a solution which worked for one newbie on one machine with
particular linux, cars, alsa drivers and you follow these suggestions at
your own risk. If you have more sophisticated setup (eg more than 1
soundcard) or more complicated needs, what follows may not be
appropriate for you.

Note: If you have kde 3.1 installed there are files you can test with
for:

-   midi: /usr/share/apps/kmid/
-   mp3: /usr/share/apps/kbattleship/sounds/
-   wav: /usr/share/sounds/

If you just want to open eg Noatun and play an mp3 and you only have 1
soundcard there are 2 issues when rebooting after you have successfully
installed the alsa drivers and devices and heard sound eg by playing
midi and mp3s.

1.  you don't want to have to reload all the modules manually and in the
    right order; and
2.  you don't want to have to open alsamixergui and unmute the master
    and PCM channels and adjust their volumes.

**Solution:**

​1. Open /etc/modules as root and add all the modules that you installed
using modprobe:

` `

    sound (remember you had to have sound loaded before you started installing alsa-driver-0.9.8)
    snd-au8820 (or 10 or 30, depending on your soundcard)
    snd-pcm-oss
    snd-mixer-oss
    snd-seq-oss

​2. Once you have opened alsamixergui or otherwise set your unmuting and
volumes, do command: alsactl --help You will see that if you do command:
alsactl store you will save your values into a configuration file saved
at /etc/asound.state You may well be able to edit that file manually
once it has been set up initially by: alsactl store

​3. Putting something like the following in your /etc/modules.conf file
(in older installations this might be conf.modules):

` `

    # ALSA portion
    alias snd-card-0 snd-interwave
    alias snd-card-1 snd-cmipci
    options snd-cmipci id="first" enable_midi="1"

    # OSS/Free portion - card #1
    alias sound-slot-0 snd-0
    alias sound-service-0-0 snd-mixer-oss
    alias sound-service-0-1 snd-seq-oss
    alias sound-service-0-3 snd-pcm-oss
    alias sound-service-0-8 snd-seq-oss
    alias sound-service-0-12 snd-pcm-oss

Setting up modprobe and kmod support
------------------------------------

Before you send a mail complaining that "I don't have /etc/modules.conf,
where do I find it ....." ,The /etc/conf.modules has been deprecated
with a few distro's so in your case, it may still be /etc/conf.modules.
Basically they are both the same, but recent version of modutils uses
/etc/modules.conf instead. Nothing to worry about as such, optionally
please update to latest version of modutils. This should solve your
problem.

Here is an example for an au8830 based card. Copy and paste this to the
bottom of your /etc/modules.conf file and change the au8830 to au8810 or
au8820 if necessary.

Note to Debian users: You need to save this information into a file --
preferably with the same name as your driver -- in the /etc/modutils/
directory (Eg. /etc/modutils/alsa) and run update-modules. See the
[modutils package](http://packages.debian.org/stable/base/modutils.html)
and the update-modules man page. *Do any other distributions use this?*

` `

    # --Sound aliases
    # ALSA portion
    alias char-major-116 snd
    alias snd-card-0 snd-au8830

    # sound options should go here

    #OSS/Free portion
    alias char-major-14 soundcore
    alias sound-slot-0 snd-card-0
    alias sound-service-0-0 snd-mixer-oss
    alias sound-service-0-1 snd-seq-oss
    alias sound-service-0-3 snd-pcm-oss
    alias sound-service-0-12 snd-pcm-oss

Unresolved Symbols
------------------

Other useful info re unresolved symbols at:
[http://www.mail-archive.com/alsa-devel%40lists.sourceforge.net/msg09813.html](http://www.mail-archive.com/alsa-devel%40lists.sourceforge.net/msg09813.html)

Read the post: [Alsa-devel] aureal driver compile problem and patch
From: Carolyn and Eric Hathaway \<10/30/2003\>

If you use the CVS files from aureal.soundforge.net instead of the
alsa-driver-0.9.8 you may need info re possible need to edit files
because of compiler incompatibilities:
[http://www.mandrakeusers.org/index.php?showtopic=4874&hl=gcc3](http://www.mandrakeusers.org/index.php?showtopic=4874&hl=gcc3)

For problems with --disable-verbose-printk add to your./configure
command eg:

` `

    ./configure --with-isapnp=no --with-cards=au8820 --with-sequencer=yes --with-oss=yes --disable-verbose-printk

Once the modules are installed following the Quick Install instructions,
make the changes to the /etc/modules/conf file as per the link above.

Note
----

NOTE: Possible need to patch some make files:

You could check this and apply the patch after running ./configure in
the alsa-drivers-xxx file.

To apply the patch you simply opne the makefile referred to in the top
of each segment of the patch and add the statements beginning with a +
(making sure you get the whole statement including any portion wrapped
to the next line. In Mdk 9.1 with KDE3.1 I use FileManager - SU mode to
locate the files, right click on them and choose open with Kwrite. I can
save when I make the changes that way. If I didn't do it htat way I
couldn't save the changes.

Questions
---------

This Install Guide doesn't work for at least Linux-kernel-2.6.{0-3}.
During ALSA configuration, I got an error; "You have built-in ALSA in
your kernel". It might work if the ALSA is disabled during kernel source
configuration. That I haven't tried yet. The AU88x0 driver is part of
kernel 2.6.5 (and above?). Which makes this Install Guide obsolete. Like
my computer. Music sounds tinny to me. 6 Apr 2004
