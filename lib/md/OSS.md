The Open Sound System (OSS) is a portable sound interface which is
available in 11 different Unix systems. It was created in 1992 by Hannu
Savolainen of Finland.

OSS was the only supported Linux sound system used up until 2.4.x
version kernels. Starting with version 2.5, ALSA was introduced, and the
OSS interface became deprecated for Linux kernels.

ALSA is the recommended interface for software that is intended to work
on Linux only. However, software that strives to be portable across
other Unixes (including the \*BSD family) typically uses OSS instead (or
supports both).

See [OssEmulation](/OssEmulation "OssEmulation") for ways to run OSS
programs on an ALSA system.
