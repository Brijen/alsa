You will have to find out the right options for the module snd-mpu401 to
get your external midi working.

You can type `modinfo snd-mpu401` to see the possible options for the
module.

To try different options, use `insmod snd-mpu401 <my-options>`. If
insmod doesn't work, type `dmesg` to get an error message which is more
meaningful. (It should be at the end of the output of dmesg.)

For my onboard "Silicon Integrated Systems" soundcard, it works using
`insmod snd-mpu401 port=0x300 irq=-1` (0x300 and 0x330 are good guesses
for the port option).

When it works, you should be able to see your soundcard with
`aconnectgui` (or `aconnect -i` and `aconnect -o`).

There are some notes about the `snd-mpu401` module in the explanation
about 'How to get the MIDI-Port of the VIA8233 working', take a look at
via8233-Via chipset.
