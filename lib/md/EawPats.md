Eawpats is abandoned, but it has been sort of reborn as
[FreePats](/FreePats "FreePats") (freepats.opensrc.org). Half of the
patches in eawpats are derived from original Gravis patches, and
therefore may have some intellectual property issues. Because of this,
and also because the bandwidth costs were getting to be too high for the
ISP to continue to eat for free out of the goodness of his heart,
eawpats was discontinued. The Gravis patches were stripped out and
rereleased as Freepats, with a few improvements over the last eawpats
release, and a few Gravis patches replaced with new good sounding
samples.
