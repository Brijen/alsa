### 2013-08-27 - Minor Updates To BS3 Template

_[Mark Constable]:_ Some minor updates to the index.php script and it's
Bootstrap 3 (final) template. Just a reminder that if anyone can help out with
managing these pages via Github then I'd really appreciate it as there is plenty
of "low hanging fruit" to pick from. Just pick any Markdown file in lib/md and
clean it up a little, or a lot :-)

View the source of [Edirol_UA-25EX] to get an idea how the layout should look
as its had the most amount of work on it to date. Create your own User:you
page and leave a note here for posterity if you care to.
