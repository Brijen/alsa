### 2013-08-27 - Minor Updates To BS3 Template

_[Mark Constable]:_ Some minor updates to the index.php script and it's
Bootstrap 3 (final) template. Just a reminder that if anyone can help out with
managing these pages via Github then I'd really appreciate it as there is plenty
of "low hanging fruit" to pick from. Chose any Markdown file in lib/md and
clean it up a little. View the source of [Edirol_UA-25EX] to get an idea how
the layout should look as its had the most amount of work on it to date. Create
your own User:you page and leave a note here for posterity if you care to.

I just discovered that if full canonical links are used then the Markdown
rendered pages at Github will obviously still point back to this site! So this
link, [Github.md], should point to this file at Github no matter which site the
link is actually clicked on. And let's try a direct edit page link at Github
for anyone who happens to have write perms.
