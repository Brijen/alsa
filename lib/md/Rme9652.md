-------

Since January 2000, the latest version of ALSA includes full support for
the RME Hammerfall and Hammerfall Light. The RME Hammerfall is the first
professional digital audio card which can use its full potential under
Linux, all 52 channels and full 24 bit resolution. The efficient driver
concept allows an operation on usual PC's at 20 ms latency and full
channel usage causing a CPU load between 2 and 5%.
