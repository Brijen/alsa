Razer Barracuda AC-1
====================

### From the ALSA wiki

Jump to: [navigation](#mw-head), [search](#p-search)

A sound card with a CMI8788 chipset developed my C-Media. It is a
10-channel card with a DAI port similar to the DVI port for digital
signaled monitors. A dongle must be used to use the soundcard outside of
connecting it to Razer's Barracuda HP-1 headphones. There is currently
not much support for this card outside of Microsoft Windows and ALSA
only began to support it in fall of 2007. It still is not fully
supported by ALSA and the Center and LFE channels are missing and in
their place is outputted the side left and right channels.
