AU600
-----

the au600 device is a usb PSTN gateway that allows using a plain old
telephone as VoIP phone.

This driver got reverse engineered, so not everything might work as
expected yet.

A note on phone suport: Referencing
[http://www.epanorama.net/circuits/telephone\_ringer.html](http://www.epanorama.net/circuits/telephone_ringer.html)
on data on what to expect from an FXS line:

"In USA minimum ring voltage supplied is 40Vrms (delivered into a 5 REN
load)."

Using a multimeter, I got about 45VAC for the ringer voltage. The manual
for the Asound TLink says it will support up to 5 phones which would
indicate a REN of 5. The USR says 3 as does the AU600. In any case, I
had a great deal of difficulty finding phones that would ring with the
adapter. I think that this device cannot quite push enough current to
ring some non-european phones or is otherwise out of spec.

Progress

Tue Okt 3 19:20:49 CEST 2006

small cleanup, the driver will only create one device instead of 2 from
now on. Also adjusted the .asoundrc file below

So Aug 20 15:44:49 CEST 2006

Since I'd like to get that device work with asterisk some more work is
needed.. after modifying chan\_alsa.c (which is part of the asterisk
project), asterisk starts to detect inband DTMF tones..

` `

    Detected inband DTMF digit: 0 on ALSA
    Detected inband DTMF digit: 0 on ALSA
    Detected inband DTMF digit: 4 on ALSA
    Detected inband DTMF digit: 3 on ALSA
    Detected inband DTMF digit: 3 on ALSA
    Detected inband DTMF digit: 3 on ALSA
    Detected inband DTMF digit: 3 on ALSA
    Detected inband DTMF digit: 6 on ALSA
    Detected inband DTMF digit: * on ALSA
    Detected inband DTMF digit: * on ALSA
    Detected inband DTMF digit: * on ALSA
    Detected inband DTMF digit: * on ALSA

since this device only works with 9600 hz you might have some problems
to play other files with a different sample rate.. alsa is capable of
converting and multiplexing different streams. Here's an example that
can be used for playback:

` `

    aplay -D plug:duplex <filename>

[.asoundrc](/.asoundrc ".asoundrc") ` `

    pcm.au600playback {
        type dmix 
        ipc_key 1024
        ipc_perm 0777
        slave {
            pcm "hw:2,0"
            period_time 0
            period_size 96 
            buffer_size 1920 
            format S16_LE
            periods 4 
            rate 9600
        }
    }

    pcm.au600capture {
        type rate
        slave {
            pcm "hw:2,0"
            format S16_LE
            rate 9600
        }
    }

    pcm.duplex {
        type asym
        playback.pcm "au600playback"
        capture.pcm "au600capture"
    }

* * * * *

-   removed some useless mixer controls (thought they were supported
    because I saw them in windows..)
-   Added support for picking up the phone directly from the PC
-   Tested DTMF dialing, works fine
-   working on sysfs callback when a call comes in

` `

    $ amixer -c 2
    Simple mixer control 'PC/PHONE',0
      Capabilities: pswitch pswitch-joined
      Playback channels: Mono
      Mono: Playback [off]
    Simple mixer control 'VOIPPSTN',0
      Capabilities: pswitch pswitch-joined
      Playback channels: Mono
      Mono: Playback [on]

-   PC/PHONE if switched on the PC picked up the line (this feature only
    works if VOIPPSTN is set to off (PSTN)
-   VOIPPSTN if switched on the device mode is set to VOIP, otherwise to
    PSTN

I figured out how playback and capturing audio is done "correctly".
Support has been added to the current development driver.

The driver isn't completly done yet but I'd say it's 90% done.

### Installation:

I developed that driver on a 2.6.16.16 kernel, so this one will probably
be the best one.

hg is also called mercurial you can get a copy from:
[http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi](http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi)

### Getting the sourcecode:

` `

    $ hg clone http://85.10.198.106/hg/~mrec/au600
    $ cd au600
    $ make
    $ insmod au600.ko

This will create an alsa device and you can use that device as usbaudio
device. Recording audio only works if playback is on.

ringing (as documented before): ` `

    $ echo 0 > /proc/au600/ring
    $ cat /proc/au600/ring
    0
    $ echo 1 > /proc/au600/ring
    $ cat /proc/au600/ring
    1

switching from PSTN to VOIP: ` `

    $ aplay -l
    $ alsamixer -c <devicenumber>

playback in linux works fine now for 47 seconds afterwards it adds some
buzz again, but I'm sure this will get fixed sooner or later. Used xmms
for testing the audio device.

ok fixed some parts of that driver.. the playback sounds clear now
\_but\_ kinda choppy (as the underruns messages indicate).

Using log2bin.pl I verified that the outgoing data is PCM 9600Hz 16 Bit
Mono (S16\_LE). log2bin plays the transfered data clearly on my other
soundcard.

SMlink sold their technology to conexant a while ago too

figured out how playback is done, poor support is already implemented.
To get it work correctly is just some extra homework now.

following line enables audio playback: ` `

    enable PCM playback:
    000658:  OUT: -00002 ms 006456 ms 40 17 c0 03 00 00 00 00 >>>

* * * * *

Sa May 6 18:09:06 CEST 2006

Todo:

-   proper locking of critical codeparts
-   implement the playback device (the outgoing format is also
    S16\_LE/9600hz I think, it's uncompressed PCM)

The premature usb driver now supports

-   recording wav files
-   and switching from PSTN to VoIP mode
-   ringing the phone

` `

    turn device on:?
    usb_control_msg(h,0x40,0x08,0xbef8,0x0000,0x00,0x00,HZ);
    enable status led:
    usb_control_msg(h,0x40,0x0a,0x10c0,0x0000,0x00,0x00,HZ);
    this sequence turns the data transfer on:
    000047:  OUT: 000002 ms 000373 ms 40 01 01 00 00 00 00 00 >>>
    000074:  OUT: -00001 ms 000501 ms 40 04 2f 00 00 00 00 00 >>>
    this sequence turns the usb data transfer off:
    000017:  OUT: 000002 ms 000264 ms 40 04 00 00 00 00 00 00 >>>
    make the phone ring:
    010809:  OUT: 000005 ms 015766 ms 40 0a c0 18 00 00 00 00 >>>
    stop ringing:
    012414:  OUT: 000007 ms 017735 ms 40 0a ca 10 00 00 00 00 >>>
    enable PCM capture:

haven't worked on that project for a long time because I wrote a driver
for an hybrid analogue TV/DVB-T usb device.. maybe I'll find some more
time during the next few days to have a look at this project..

After updating the driver an app came up that supports recording. I
compared the captured raw usb stream with the content of that recorded
audio file that was stored on my disk -- everything's identical!

implemented isoc out transfer to the device - the interrupt and isoc
endpoints are handled now, I also do receive raw data from the device
now. Next step would be to analyze the received data.. well another day
then..

` `

    isoc packet with length: 18

looks like the same information is also accessable using the read
control message "c0 95 00 00 00 00 02 00"

c4 50 and c4 10 is also returned within the IRQ function

IRQ responses:

this comes back if the phone is switched to VoIP, and the phone is off
the station (active to speak)

` `

    data: 0x41 0x0 0xc4 0x10
    data: 0xc1 0x0 0xc4 0x10

following data is received if the phone is switched to VoIP and not
active

` `

    data: 0x41 0x0 0xc4 0x50
    data: 0xc1 0x0 0xc4 0x50

next one comes in if the phone is switched to PSTN and not active (I
have no PSTN connection here atm maybe there might show up something
else if it's connected to the PSTN network I'll test it later)

` `

    data: 0xc1 0x0 0x0 0x40
    data: 0x41 0x0 0x0 0x40
    data: 0x41 0x0 0x0 0x40

enough for today...time for gettin a beer

implemented isoc in transfer from the device, as well as interrupt
transfers (code looks quite dirty now and the packets which are received
are empty .. this is very likely because of a wrong device configuration
which has to be set up using usb control messages .. so far so go od the
device already plays ping pong with my notebook ..)

most important is to know what alternate number was used within the
windows driver:

` `

    $ grep -i Altern usbsnoop.log
      Interface[0]: AlternateSetting  = 1
      Interface[0]: AlternateSetting  = 1

so we fixate on Alternate number 1

What endpoint pins are used? .. ` `

    grep -i endpoint * | sort | uniq
      Interface[0]: Pipes[0] : EndpointAddress   = 0x00000081
      Interface[0]: Pipes[1] : EndpointAddress   = 0x00000002
      Interface[0]: Pipes[2] : EndpointAddress   = 0x00000083
      PipeHandle = 80e02e80 [endpoint 0x00000081]
      PipeHandle           = 80e02e80 [endpoint 0x00000081]
      PipeHandle = 80e02e9c [endpoint 0x00000002]
      PipeHandle           = 80e02e9c [endpoint 0x00000002]
      PipeHandle = 80e02eb8 [endpoint 0x00000083]
      PipeHandle           = 80e02eb8 [endpoint 0x00000083]

So 81, 02 and 83 are used we also see them in configuration 0 alternate
1 good :) ` `

    81 is an interrupt endpoint
    02 an isochronous out data endpoint
    83 an isochronous in data endpoint

implemented a mixer control for switching from PSTN to VoIP

` `

    debian:/devel/usb/usbfs/aufgabe5# amixer -c 2
    Simple mixer control 'Master',0
      Capabilities: volume volume-joined
      Playback channels: Mono
      Limits: 0 - 256
      Mono: 0 [0%]
    Simple mixer control 'Midi',0
      Capabilities: volume volume-joined
      Playback channels: Mono
      Limits: 0 - 256
      Mono: 0 [0%]
    Simple mixer control 'VoIP Input Select',0
      Capabilities: pswitch pswitch-joined
      Playback channels: Mono
     Mono: Playback [off]

` `

    Index 0x0
    IndexValues:
    1000011000000 .. 0x10c0 VoIP
    0000011000000 .. 0x00c0 PSTN

    the first bit is for switching to VoIP if it's 1 the device is set to VoIP

    0000010000000 .. 0x80 this bit toggles the Link led
    0000000000000 .. 0x00
