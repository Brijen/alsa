What is MIDI?
-------------

### Introduction

MIDI is an international standard for communicating music as electronic
messages from one musical instrument or computer to another musical
instrument or computer. MIDI is very useful for composing and playing
music using musical instruments such as [MIDI
keyboards](/MIDI_keyboards "MIDI keyboards") (e.g. Roland, Yamaha
Clavinovas,...). To use MIDI, you typically need a computer with ***MIDI
software*** as well as a MIDI keyboard (any MIDI instrument is ok) which
you connect using [MIDI cable](/MIDI_cable "MIDI cable") to a [MIDI
interface](/MIDI_interface "MIDI interface") on the computer's
[soundcard](/Soundcard "Soundcard").

[ALSA](/ALSA "ALSA") has full support for MIDI. If your computer's
soundcard has a [MIDI interface](/MIDI_interface "MIDI interface") (most
[soundcards](/Soundcard "Soundcard") do), you can make music using MIDI.
Alternatively, you can use USBMidiDevices to connect your PC via one of
its USB ports to a MIDI keyboard or instrument. You will also need some
MIDI sequencer software on your computer such as
[Rosegarden](/Rosegarden "Rosegarden") or [MusE](/MusE "MusE"). The
following two links are to pages on this Wiki that explain various ways
of [playingMIDIFiles](/PlayingMIDIFiles "PlayingMIDIFiles") and of
[recording MIDI files](/Recording_MIDI_files "Recording MIDI files").

**MIDI** is an acronym for "***M***usical ***I***nstrument ***D***igital
***I***nterface".
