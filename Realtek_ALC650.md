Realtek ALC650
==============

### From the ALSA wiki

Jump to: [navigation](#mw-head), [search](#p-search)

The Realtek ALC650 is a 6-channel audio chip which supports the
'traditional' Intel Audio Codec 1997 (AC'97) standard. For use with a
computer, the chip needs to be connected to one of the computer buses.
This may be done via a dedicated soundcard or, if the chip is on the
motherboard, by direct connection to the motherboard southbridge.

Overview
--------

As input the ALC650 accepts digital PCM (pulse coded modulation) data
from the computer and analogue signals from a CD, microphone, telephone
and other audio equipment. PCM data is first converted to an analogue
signal. The different analogue signals can then be amplified and
combined to produce the main stero line-out signal. Output to the
additional four analogue output channels can come either from their own
PCM input channels or from the line-out signal.

In a separate analogue path through the chip, the input analogue signals
(plus the line-out signal) can be combined and amplified to produce a
digital output signal for input to the computer. The chip can also send
and receive data from other audio devices using the Sony/Phillips
Digital Interface Format (S/P DIF).

Motherboard Chips and Alsa Drivers
----------------------------------

If the motherboard is based on one of the Nvidia Nforce chipsets it
should be possible to control the chip using the
[intel8x0](/Intel8x0 "Intel8x0") Alsa kernel module which supports the
Nvidia interface. If the motherboard is based on a Via chipset, the
ALC650 may be connected to a Via8233 southbridge or similar chip. In
that case it should be possible to control the ALC650 using the
[via82xx](?title=Via82xx&action=edit&redlink=1 "Via82xx (page does not exist)")
Alsa kernel module. Note that in such cases the system will appear to
contain a Nvidia or Via soundcard whose name is the name of the
southbridge chip.

Installation of a via82xx Driver
--------------------------------

### Installation

-   Download alsa-driver alsa-lib and alsa-utils
    [[1]](http://www.alsa-project.org/download.php3)
-   Untar and place the directories in `/usr/src`.

### Compiling

Alsa-driver:

` `

    ./configure
    make install
    ./snddevices

Alsa-lib:

` `

    ./configure
    make install

Alsa-utils:

` `

    ./configure
    make install

### Install Driver

Run
[alsaconf](?title=Alsaconf&action=edit&redlink=1 "Alsaconf (page does not exist)")
and follow the onscreen instructions. It should generate a section in
your `/etc/modules.conf` that looks like this:

` `

    # --- BEGIN: Generated by ALSACONF, do not edit. ---
    # --- ALSACONF verion 0.9.0 ---
    alias char-major-116 snd
    alias snd-card-0 snd-via82xx
    alias char-major-14 soundcore
    alias sound-slot-0 snd-card-0
    alias sound-service-0-0 snd-mixer-oss
    alias sound-service-0-1 snd-seq-oss
    alias sound-service-0-3 snd-pcm-oss
    alias sound-service-0-8 snd-seq-oss
    alias sound-service-0-12 snd-pcm-oss
    options snd major=116 cards_limit=1 device_mode=0666
    options snd-via82xx index=0
    # --- END: Generated by ALSACONF, do not edit. ---

[SPDIF](/SPDIF "SPDIF") support
-------------------------------

It took me a sec to figure this one out, and I don't know if it's just
my setup. [SPDIF](/SPDIF "SPDIF") support is controlled by the sound
control element called 'IEC958 Playback AC97-SPSA'. The gnome mixer
program does NOT control the SPDIF output (the 'digital' output is
something different). You can control it through
[alsamixer](/Alsamixer "Alsamixer") or [amixer](/Amixer "Amixer") in the
console (or you could use the alsa mixer for gnome
[[2]](http://www.paw.za.org/projects/gnome-alsamixer/)). The other trick
is that the 'percentage' for output needs to be **zero** for the output.

Putting this in your `/etc/rc.d/rc.local` should fix this:

` `

    amixer set 'IEC958 Playback AC97-SPSA' 0

from the [via8233](/Via8233 "Via8233") page, this is expalined as
follows...

If the playback device indicates a link is present, but makes no sound,
check the mixer 'IEC958 Playback AC97-SPSA'. The S/PDIF always outputs
at full volume - even muting the master or PCM mixers does not affect
the S/PDIF volume. The meanings of the settings for 'IEC958 Playback
AC97-SPSA' are

` `

    0. PCM1
    1. PCM2,PCM1 (rear)
    2. Centre and LFE
    3. PCM3,Modem,Dedicated S/PDIF

Most users will want it set to 0 (PCM1). Some of the 82xx chips have a
dedicated S/PDIF port, which is (I assume) accessed by setting it to 3
(Dedicated S/PDIF). The default appears to be 3.

The driver's been rock solid for me for a week! Happy listening! Please
note that I only use the SPDIF support, although I have confirmed
working analog output, too. Your mileage may vary.
