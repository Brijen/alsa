In general usage, **channel** is the path between two endpoints but in
ALSA audio terminology, a channel is usually considered to be the
[stream](/Stream "Stream") of audio data itself.

Channels are somewhat ambiguous because they can refer to just a single
component of the audio stream (for example, the "left channel" of a
stereo signal) or to the entire stream itself (e.g., the "MIDI channel"
of a stereo sample).
