Module options

This is pulled directly from the Alsa-HOWTO, then reformatted.

ESS Maestro-1/2/2E -ES1968/ES1978 series Module snd-card-es1968.o for
soundcards based on ESS Maestro-1/2/2E -ES1968/ES1978 series chips. This
Module supports up to 8 cards and autoprobe.

` `

    snd_dac_frame_size  - max dac playback frame size in kB, 4-64kB
    snd_adc_frame_size  - max adc record frame size in kB, 4-64kB
    snd_gesbuf          - total buffer size in kB, 1-4096kB
    snd_midi_enable     - enable MIDI support 0 = off, 1 = on
    snd_pcm_channels_p  - playback channels 1-8, default=2
    snd_pcm_channels_c  - capture channels, 1-8, default=0

Since (at least) ALSA 1.0 this has changed. The options are now:

` `

    index          - Index
    id          - ID for ALSA to use
    enable          - whether to enable the card
    total_bufsize       - total buffer size in kB, 1-4096kB
    pcm_substreams_p    - number of PCM playback channels
    pcm_substreams_c    - same for capturing (recording)
    clock           -Â ? (use 0 for autodetect)
    use_pm          - Attemp power managment (0 = off, 1 = on, 2 = auto)
    enable_mpu      - Enable MPU401 (0 = off, 1 = on, 2= auto)

All options are arrays, with array position corresponding to card
number. I.e. `id=card0,,foo` would call the first card `'card0'` (the
default), let the driver choose the default for the second card and call
the third card `'foo'`.

Extra notes
-----------

1.  This card is one of the few that supports hardware mixing in ALSA.
    You can have upto four applications playing at the same time through
    the stereo output. - Patrick Shirkey
2.  This is not the same card as the ES1969. - A.M.
