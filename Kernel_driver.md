Kernel driver
=============

### From the ALSA wiki

A **kernel driver** is a program which tells the kernel how to use a
piece of hardware, such as a disk drive or a sound card. Drivers can be
statically compiled into a kernel, in which case the kernel and the
driver are the same program file, or drivers can be used as kernel
modules, in which case the driver program can be loaded from a seperate
file and unloaded if it needs to be changed (or to save space, avoid
breaking some other module, etc).
