**Lilypond: Music Notation for Everyone** -- A wonderful open-source
music notation program that uses a completely different approach from
commercial alternatives such as Finale and Sibelius, and produces
arguably the finest scores of all notation programs. The slight learning
curve is worth the effort, and an email list provides excellent support.
