Gadget Labs is a company that made sound cards at the end of the 1990s.
They made "prosumer" quality cards. Similar performance to professional
equipment with a lower price.

Founded by some ex-Intel people, they were never too keen on Linux and
open source.

Not suprisingly, the company has since gone out of business. Some source
code for beta Windows drivers has been found. See the Gadget Labs user
group page at

for the aesthetically squeamish: bright colors and animated GIFS on a
black background!)

I have written an Alsa driver for my Gadget Labs sound card.

The information I've gathered is on:
[http://mlug.missouri.edu/\~markrages/static/projects/gadgetlabs.php3](http://mlug.missouri.edu/~markrages/static/projects/gadgetlabs.php3)

I had some stuff on my personal Wiki about
[WritingAnAlsaDriver](/WritingAnAlsaDriver "WritingAnAlsaDriver"). I'll
move it here where it belongs.

The code is posted here as a patch to Alsa:
[http://mlug.missouri.edu/\~markrages/static/projects/gldriver](http://mlug.missouri.edu/~markrages/static/projects/gldriver)

If anyone uses it, successfully or no, please email [Mark
Rages](/User:MarkRages "User:MarkRages"). I have the impression there
are not too many of these cards around.
