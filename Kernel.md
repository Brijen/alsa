Jump to: [navigation](#mw-head), [search](#p-search)

The core of the operating system, the program which runs all other
programs. Different operating systems such as Windows XP, Linux, Mac OS
X, FreeBSD, and so on each have their own Kernel. Which version of the
Linux kernel a system is running can affect ALSA's operation.
