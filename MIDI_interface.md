Almost every [soundcard](/Soundcard "Soundcard") has a **MIDI
interface** for connecting [MIDI](/MIDI "MIDI") devices using an [MIDI
cable](/MIDI_cable "MIDI cable"). The MIDI interface has two rows of
closely-spaced holes, one row with 8 holes and the other row with 7
holes. The connector that joins onto the MIDI interface is called a
"*15-pin D-type connector*".
