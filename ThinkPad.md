ThinkPad

### From the ALSA wiki

Jump to: [navigation](#mw-head), [search](#p-search)

See the [ThinkPad600](/ThinkPad600 "ThinkPad600") page for the
information about configuring the Alsa Sound drivers for the IBM
[ThinkPad600](/ThinkPad600 "ThinkPad600") Laptop... these notes may be
valid for other thinkpads too. The IBM Bios Update Instructions say the
[Thinkpad Simple Boot](/Thinkpad_Simple_Boot "Thinkpad Simple Boot")
flag must be disabled for the 600, 600E, 600X, 770, 770E, and 770ED.
Also, I've seen mail in the linux-thinkpad mailing list that suggest
even Thinkpads with CS46xx chips can use the cs4232/cs4236 drivers,
though personally I'd try the
[CS46xx](?title=CS46xx&action=edit&redlink=1 "CS46xx (page does not exist)")
drivers first.

**Links to Thinkpad websites:**

These first two are great, pretty current (as of Jan 2003) pages. They
talk about sound, but so much more as well. Check them out!

-   Thomas Hood's "Debian GNU/Linux on an IBM Thinkpad 600" webpage.
    Chock full of good things. He's tried everything!
    [http://panopticon.csustan.edu/thood/tp600lnx.htm](http://panopticon.csustan.edu/thood/tp600lnx.htm)

-   Raph Levien's Linux Page. Especially see his info about the
    batteries.
    [http://www.levien.com/tp600.html](http://www.levien.com/tp600.html)

-   The tpctl page: if you're sick of PS2.EXE under DOS, you want
    tcpctl. This page also discusses why pnpdump doesn't work, and bugs
    with lspnp and setpnp in older Linux 2.4 kernels.
    [http://tpctl.sourceforge.net/tpctlhome.htm](http://tpctl.sourceforge.net/tpctlhome.htm)

-   The linux on a thinkpad mailing list (yes, at the top it says
    Thinkpad 770-- but it really has mail regarding any Thinkpad model).
    If you have a Linux Thinkpad problem you can't solve anywhere else,
    the answer is probably somewhere here.
    [http://www.linux-thinkpad.org/bm/tp\_mailing.html](http://www.linux-thinkpad.org/bm/tp_mailing.html)

-   The IBM support site, which has downloads (like PS2.EXE for
    configuring the sound system) and documentation. The Thinkpad 600 is
    model 2645-51U, the 600X is 2646-8EU.
