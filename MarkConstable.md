Wow, time flies. Here is a 1:18 minute quick and simple test AVI screen
capture using Xvidcap on Linux. It is very rough and the sound drops out
a bit it's enough to test a video on this site. The subject is testing
the default KDE audio mixer, Kmix, to get reasonable audio levels from a
cheap Creative microphone along with testing line-in and wav playback
levels through an old SBlive audio card (on Kubuntu Dapper). If you set
up your browser to use VLC for video/x-msvideo mime.type then the
download link might stream on a broadband link. Other players may work
but I find VLC "just works" for most media off the web. ` `

    VIDEO:  [MP42]  572x246  24bpp  10.000 fps   86.3 kbps (10.5 kbyte/s)
    Selected video codec: [ffmp42] vfm: ffmpeg (FFmpeg M$ MPEG-4 v2)

    AUDIO: 22050 Hz, 2 ch, s16le, 32.0 kbit/4.54% (ratio: 4000->88200)
    Selected audio codec: [mp3] afm: mp3lib (mp3lib MPEG layer-2, layer-3)

Oh man, now I've done it... I've gone and added myself to the
FreeSoftwareMusicians list so I'll have to, uhm, make some music now I
guess. Yes, I admit to being your classic lurking wanabe done-nothing
muso but I'll try to actually do something... sometime this year. I said
that last year, and the year before that too, but this is the year of my
maximum resolve to create at least one 3 minute orderly arrangement of
bits in a wav file and put it up for public ridicule.

I've made my first attempts at creating a few minutes of something that
will become an "oggshow", which is similar in presentation to a podcast
but in Ogg/Vorbis format and destined to be streamed instead of being
transferred to any iPod-like device. The first major stumbling block
I've reached is how to get the signal "hot" enough but without clipping
distortion so any advice and hints on how to get a well saturated wav
file with post-processing in Audacity would be greatly appreciated. Here
is an image from one of Adam Curry's Daily Source Code podcasts which
looks and sounds great, note how "fat" the middle lighter color is... if
I try and get anywhere near this level of saturation I get clipping...
whereas DSC podcasts do not clip.

Howdy folks. I'll try and use this area a bit like a blog of my personal
progress using A/V tools on linux. My meagre audio equipment consists of
my little Shuttle/AMD64 workstation plus the equipment listed below.
This listing is not to show off, or to admit how little music gear I
have, but to let others know exactly what equipment do I have so I can
offer some advice or opinion about the same or similar items.

### Equipment List

    2 x Behringer B1 condenser mics
    Tascam US-122 24/48 USB sound card
    MK-4902 mini MIDI Keyboard (thanks Rodrigo!)
    Sony MDR-7506 Headphones (thanks Rodrigo!)
    Ibanez Roadstar Series II Bass (w/ low B string)
